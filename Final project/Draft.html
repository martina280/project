			<h2>Why is there famine?</h2>	
		Famine in Africa is caused by a lack of food, with 1 in 3 children affected. This problem is made worse by unfairness, ongoing wars, and climate change. These issues make it harder for people to get enough food, especially in countries like Somalia, South Africa, and Uganda, where droughts and conflict stop people from growing and getting food. As a result, many children and families suffer from hunger and poor health

			Many children in Africa suffer from malnutrition due to poverty, food shortages, and poor healthcare. This leads to stunted growth, weak immune systems, and increased illness. Conflict, climate change, and economic struggles make the situation worse. More efforts are needed to ensure all children get enough food to stay healthy.
