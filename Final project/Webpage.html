            Many children in Africa suffer from malnutrition due to poverty, food shortages, and poor healthcare. This leads to stunted growth, weak immune systems, and increased illness. Conflict, climate change, and economic struggles make the situation worse. More efforts are needed to ensure all children get enough food to stay healthy.
